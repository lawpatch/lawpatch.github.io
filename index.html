            <p>LawPatch is a collection of open source legal language that is linked
                into contracts with URLs.</p>

            <p>Using LawPatch shortens documents and makes them easier to understand
                for non lawyers. We are also looking at LawPatch as a way to create
                a layer of legal language that is consistent across jurisdictions.</p>

            <p>Here's what LawPatch looks like in practice.</p>

            <table>
                <tr>
                    <th style="width:50%"><b class="bold">LawPatch (14 words)</b>
                    </th>
                    <th style="width:50%"><b class="bold">Legalese (76 words)</b>
                    </th>

                        Customer for the Services.</td>
                    <td style="padding:10px;">Client deals with Provider in respect of the Services at its
                        own risk. To the fullest extent permitted by law, Provider
                        excludes all liability (including any kind of consequential
                        or indirect loss like loss of profits, pure economic loss
                        or loss of opportunity) to Client for any liabilities connected
                        directly or indirectly with the dealings of the Client
                        and the Provider in relation to the Services, including
                        liabilities based on contract law, tort law and legislation.</td>

            <h3>
Getting Started
</h3>

            <p>Using a patch is easy. There are three steps:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Choose the patch you want to use from the table below;</li>
                <li>click “Get” to display the text used to import the patch; and</li>
                <li>paste the text into your agreement.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>If you’d like to play it safe, use something like the following clause
                in agreements that you use LawPatch in.</p>

            <div class="clause-card">
                The parties agree to this document using LawPatch language. The LawPatch language
                referenced by hyperlink is legally effective. Text in the hyperlink
                is for convenience only and is not legally effective.</div>

            <h3>Open Source Contributions</h3>

            <p>If you'd like to contribute a patch, we'd love to hear from you. Email
                Pat on pat{at}codepact{dot}com with the language. You'll need to have
                the right intellectual property rights to contribute of course.</p>
            <p>To get you thinking, we think this technique concept could work well
                with:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>dispute resolution processes;</li>
                <li>confidentiality; and</li>
                <li>indemnities.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>More Info</h3>
            <p>We use Github.com to host the language for LawPatch. For an explanation
                on the versioning system used for the language, check <a href="https://github.com/lawpatch/lawpatch-docs/blob/master/versioning.md">this</a> out.</p>
            <p>
                Do not use a URL referring to the Github repo as a whole. This can easily be interpreted
                as importing the language as updated. We will be making substantive
                changes to the language, so there will be unintended consequences
                if you do this.
            </p>
            <p>Here’s an <a href="http://blog.codepact.com/lawpatch/">article on how LawPatch evolved</a> and
                the legal problem it solves.</p>
            <p>LawPatch is also in the beginnings of creating an open source dictionary
                <a href="https://github.com/lawpatch/dictionary">here</a>.
            </p>
            <h3>Be Careful</h3>
            <p>
                The legal language referred to on this page is not legal advice, and the people
                working on it are not your lawyers.
            </p>
            <p>
                The patches are useful in many situations, but they are not applicable in all.
                That means you need to be careful with them. Before you use them
                in an agreement, speak with a lawyer.</p>
