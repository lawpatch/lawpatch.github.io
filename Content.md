LawPatch is a collection of open source legal language that can be linked into contracts with a URL linking very simple clauses.

Using LawPatch shortens documents and makes them easier to understand for non lawyers.  We are also using LawPatch to create a layer of legal language that is consistent across jurisdictions.

### Getting Started

Using a patch is easy.  There are three steps:

- Choose the patch you want to use from the tables below;
- click “Get” to display the text used to import the patch; and
- paste the text into your agreement.

You can click “Explanation” for further explanation on how to use the variables built into a patch.

Here’s an example:

```
[example]
```

If you’d like to play it safe, use something like the following clause in agreements that you use LawPatch in.

```
[text]
```

Do not use a URL referring to the Github repo as a whole. This can easily be interpreted as importing the language as updated. We will be making substantive changes to the language, so there will be unintended consequences if you do this.

### Open Source Contributions

If you'd like to contribute a patch, we'd love to hear from you. Email Pat on pat@codepact.com with the language. You'll need to have the right intellectual property rights to contribute of course.

To get you thinking, we think this technique concept could work well with:

- dispute resolution processes;
- confidentiality; and
- indemnities.

### More Info

We use Github.com to host the language for LawPatch.  For an explanation on the versioning system used for the language, check [this](docs) out.

Here’s an [article on how LawPatch evolved](http://blog.codepact.com), and how it works.

LawPatch is also in the beginnings of creating an open source dictionary [here](https://github.com/lawpatch/dictionary).

### Be Careful

The legal language referred to on this page is not legal advice, and the people working on it are not your lawyers.

The patches are useful in many situations, but they are not applicable in all. That means you need to be careful with them. Before you use them in an agreement, speak with a lawyer - it should only take them 10 minutes to figure out if they're right for your situation (find a new lawyer if it takes any longer than that).
